# Ionic-transitions

This project is built for exploring performace of Ionic on Native Android. 
Initial commits contain code for basic transitions and also a smooth scrolling feature which will work well on all versions of Android.

#Popover works fine in Android Marshmallow
key here is all the dependencies (ionic, cordova, jdk, android SDK) must be up-to-date. Background colors and all other css or scss
work fine.
